# Notice
The slides for the presentation will be posted later this evening due to a technical issue regarding server the presentation is being compiled on. In the interim, I've added the package and some code.

To obtain it:
```r
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github("coatless/pims_bigdata/")
```

# Background
Powering Up the Spatial Computation given at University of British Columbia during PIMS' Big Data and Environmental Sciences
